# Battleship

This is a wip for a battleship game I am working on.

To start working on this project, you must install some npm packages.

Run this command:

```
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli jest babel-jest @babel/preset-env identity-obj-proxy
```

This will install webpack and jest locally, so webpack can build your development project and allow you to test with jest.
